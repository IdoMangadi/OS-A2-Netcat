4. cover case of same port given as two arguments
5. There are some global variables now, might want to change it, but it requries passing the variables to basicly every function
6.To check unix domain socket options - segmentation fault fixed, seems that everyting works. 
6.5 - Im leaving you to recheck stuff when running the gcov tests. I think it's done.
7.make gcov

few notes:
1. when running: UDPS with -i and UDPC with -o the client get twice input any time

// handling the communication between the user and the server/client:
    int original_input_fd = STDIN_FILENO, original_output_fd = STDOUT_FILENO;  // saving terminal input and keyboard output:
    fds[fds_size++] = original_input_fd;
    fds[fds_size++] = original_output_fd;

    // creating access to original output strem:
    FILE *original_os = fdopen(original_output_fd, "w");
    if (original_os == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "fdopen failed");
        close_fds(fds, fds_size, EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    // creating access to original input strem:
    FILE *original_is = fdopen(original_input_fd, "r");
    if (original_is == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "fdopen failed");
        close_fds(fds, fds_size, EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
